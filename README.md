# vitabright

Vitabright is a plugin enabling you to alter the luminosity levels of your PS Vita. It thus allows you to decrease the brightness level below the minimum, and increase it above the maximum.
**This plugin is compatible with both OLED (PS Vita 1000) and LCD (PS Vita 2000) models. Tested to be functional on 3.60 Ens≈ç, 3.65 h-encore, 3.67 h-encore and 3.68 h-encore**.

## Installation

- Download the latest version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/skgleba/vitabright/releases) to `ur0:/tai/`.
- Add `ur0:/tai/vitabright.skprx` below `*KERNEL` in the `ur0:/tai/config.txt` file.

**Important note**: If you have a folder `ux0:/tai` on your memory stick, it will prevent plugins in `ur0:/tai` from loading. In order to fix this, delete the folder `ux0:/tai`.

## Usage

- Once vitabright is installed and your Vita is restarted, it will automatically work. Just open the brightness settings and move the slider.
- You can edit the OLED gamma table with the lut editor (vpk in [releases](https://github.com/skgleba/vitabright/releases))
